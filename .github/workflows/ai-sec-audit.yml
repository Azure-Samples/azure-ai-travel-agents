          You are an experienced cloud-security engineer with deep knowledge of Azure, DevSecOps, and secure software design.
            Task: Perform a full security audit of the GitHub repository https://github.com/azure-ai-travel-agents/azure-ai-travel-agents.
            Scope to cover
            Source-code vulnerabilities - input validation, secrets, insecure API usage, error handling.
            Dependency risks - outdated or vulnerable libraries (direct & transitive).
            Configuration and secrets management - hard-coded credentials, Key Vault/ENV usage, IaC misconfigs.
            Identity & access control (IAM) - GitHub Actions permissions, Azure roles, service principals, workflow secrets.
            Cloud posture - network exposure, HTTPS enforcement, logging, private endpoints, managed identity usage.
            Best-practice alignment - OWASP Top 10, NIST, Azure Well-Architected Framework.
            Deliverable (Markdown):
            Introduction (what you audited & methodology).
            Detailed Findings under each scope area.
            Key-findings table with columns: Severity · Issue · File/Location · Recommendation.
            Conclusion & prioritized action list.
            Style:
            Clear headings, concise bullets, code snippets where helpful.
            Severity levels: High / Medium / Low.
            Use a landscape-friendly table for key findings.
            Output only the report — no extraneous commentary.
